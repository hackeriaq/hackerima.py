2 part app: cli/gui

The cli command, readelf.py, should be standard python. It does run
some system commands like readelf, file, and ldd.

gui all lives under "compliance".

Both the web app and the cli rely on Django 1.8.  Older or newer
versions of Django may work, but changes to the APIs may cause
problems.  Because of this dependency, Python 2.7 is strongly
recommended as well.

By default, typing "make" in the top-level will create the SQLite
  database both apps need.
 
linkage: bulk of the gui code
  models.py is the database/form models
  views.py is the data/form processing code

media: css/images/docs

templates: html pages using django's "template" language for data/form
	   handling (these also have some javascript glue)

The web app can be run three ways:

 - "In-place" (see below)

 - Installed using the normal "python setup.py install".

 - Run from /opt/linuxfoundation/compliance.

To run the gui/server (as user compliance for installed package):
   /opt/linuxfoundation/bin/deps-checker.py start (for running installed)
   
To run the application in place, you *must* first run "make" to create the
database and docs, as well as populate the db with the static data:
   make
   bin/deps-checker.py start (for running in-place)

To run the application after "python setup.py install", use
  dep-checker.py from the usual binary directory.  This is usually
  /usr/local/bin for regular installs, or the bin directory in a
  virtualenv.

"deps-checker.py stop" will stop the server.

to access the gui: http://127.0.0.1:8000/linkage
admin interface: http://127/0.0.1:8000/admin 
	(username compliance, password compliance)
